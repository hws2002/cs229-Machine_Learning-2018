# Image
`peppers-small.tiff` is of shape (128, 128, 3)  
To get the (r,g,b) at pixel position (i,j) : A[i,j,:] or A[i,j,]  


# Centroids $\mu_i$
$\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_{16} \in \R^3$  
where each elements representing red, green, blue intensity.  
They are updated by the following fomula  
$\mu_j = {\sum_{i=1}^n 1{c^{(i)} = j}x^{(j)} \over \sum_{i=1}^n1{c^{(i)} = j}}$

# $C^{(i)}$

$C^{(i)} = \argmin_j||x^{(i)} - \mu_j||_2^2$

# Break condition
I ran the code for 50 and 100 iterations, and due to the fact that k-means sometimes end up with local minima, repeated for 5 times each.  
It roughly took 3 minutes to finish compression when threshold was 50 iteratoins, and 6 minutes for 100.
